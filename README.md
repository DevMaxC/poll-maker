# Poll Maker

A Project made in the t3 stack (Next, React, TS, Tailwind, Prisma) to allow users to create polls.




## Deployment

I deployed this project myself on vercel.

With a planetscale database.

If you wish to use a non mySQL database, change the type in prisma.schema



## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

`DATABASE_URL` - the database url to connect to. (The planetscale has a vercel integration, will auto generate this for you if added and specified with prisma)
